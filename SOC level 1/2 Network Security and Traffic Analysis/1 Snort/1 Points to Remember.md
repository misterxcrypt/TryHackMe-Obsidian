There are ==six DAQ modules== available in Snort;

- **Pcap:** Default mode, known as Sniffer mode.
- **Afpacket:** Inline mode, known as IPS mode.
- **Ipq:** Inline mode on Linux by using Netfilter. It replaces the snort_inline patch.  
- **Nfq:** Inline mode on Linux.
- **Ipfw:** Inline on OpenBSD and FreeBSD by using divert sockets, with the pf and ipfw firewalls.  
    
- **Dump:** Testing mode of inline and normalisation.

The most popular modes are the default (pcap) and inline/IPS (Afpacket).
