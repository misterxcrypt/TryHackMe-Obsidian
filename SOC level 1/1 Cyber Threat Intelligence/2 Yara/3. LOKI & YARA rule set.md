# LOKI


> [!NOTE] Note #note
> As a security analyst, you may need to research various threat intelligence reports, blog postings, etc. and gather information on the latest tactics and techniques used in the wild, past or present. Typically in these readings, IOCs (hashes, IP addresses, domain names, etc.) will be shared so rules can be created to detect these threats in your environment, along with Yara rules.

On the flip side, you might find yourself in a situation where you've encountered something unknown, that your security stack of tools can't/didn't detect. Using tools such as Loki, <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">you will need to add your own rules based on your threat intelligence gathers</span> or findings from an incident response engagement (forensics).

==Loki already has a set of Yara rules that we can benefit from and start scanning for evil on the endpoint straightaway.==
