> When a URL is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the web page, technologies utilised and other metadata about the website.

The site provides two views, the first one showing the ==most recent scans== performed and the second one showing ==current live scans==.

## Scan Results

URL scan results provide ample information, with the following key areas being essential to look at:

- **Summary:** Provides general information about the URL, ranging from the identified IP address, domain registration details, page history and a screenshot of the site.
- **HTTP:** Provides information on the HTTP connections made by the scanner to the site, with details about the data fetched and the file types received.
- **Redirects:** Shows information on any identified HTTP and client-side redirects on the site.
- **Links:** Shows all the identified links outgoing from the site's homepage.
- **Behaviour:** Provides details of the variables and cookies found on the site. These may be useful in identifying the frameworks used in developing the site.
- **Indicators:** Lists all IPs, domains and hashes associated with the site. These indicators do not imply malicious activity related to the site.
